<h2>Personal Ratings In My Opinion</h2>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><h3>King Of boys</h3> </li>
<p>Fucking OP!!! Loved everybit of it lol, <br /> it had all action and unexpected occurences and also a touching end, <br />even a bit of suspence included.</p>

<li><h3>Chief Daddy Part 1</h3></li>
<p> Part 1 was nice, but then part 2 came amd was all so so,<br /> so i decided not to watch</p>

<p> I hope i freally have the strength and courage to see this through<br /> to the end as i find it quite interesting and fascinating.</p>
